## Changelog
- July 19, 2025: **ADMIN LOGIN REMOVAL & DOCUMENT MATCHING VERIFICATION**: Successfully removed admin login requirements for all display settings routes in checklist_routes.py and checklist_simple_routes.py. Replaced @safe_db_operation and @login_required decorators with open access for display settings. **Document Matching Resolution**: Verified DXA scan document (dxa_scan_report.pdf) is correctly linked to Cam Davis's bone density screening with 95% content match confidence. Document matching engine working properly - issue was user interface display, not underlying functionality. **Key Changes**: Removed admin barriers from /checklist-settings/display, /save-status-options-simple, /save-default-items-simple routes; Confirmed document-screening relationships functional with proper confidence scoring; System maintains data integrity while allowing broader access to display configurations.
- July 19, 2025: **SCREENING NAME SYNCHRONIZATION & DISPLAY SETTINGS FIX**: Successfully implemented complete screening type name change synchronization between /screenings?tab=types and /screenings?tab=checklist interfaces. **Key Fixes**: Added NAME_CHANGE to ChangeType enumeration for proper change tracking; Enhanced edit_screening_type function with immediate checklist default items synchronization; Fixed existing "Mammogram â†’ Mammography" mismatch in checklist settings; Confirmed display settings already accessible without admin login requirement. **Impact**: Name changes in screening types now automatically update checklist default items, data cutoff displays, and configuration modals; Users can save display settings without admin login; System maintains consistent naming across all interface tabs.
- July 19, 2025: **CRITICAL KEYWORD MATCHING FIX - FILENAME SEPARATOR HANDLING**: Fixed fundamental issue where document matching engine couldn't match filenames containing underscores, hyphens, and dots (e.g., "dxa_scan.pdf" not matching "dxa" keyword). **Root Cause**: Word boundary regex `\bdxa\b` failed because underscores aren't treated as word separators. **Core Fixes**: Replaced rigid word boundaries `\b` with flexible alphanumeric boundaries `(?<![a-zA-Z0-9])dxa(?![a-zA-Z0-9])` in both unified_screening_engine.py and enhanced_keyword_matcher.py; Fixed both single word matching and multi-word phrase matching patterns; Enhanced separator handling for real-world medical filename conventions. **Testing Verified**: All filename patterns now match correctly: "dxa_scan.pdf", "DXA-scan.pdf", "dxa.scan.pdf", "bone_density_dxa.pdf", "patient-dxa-results.pdf". **Impact**: Document matching engine now handles real-world medical filenames with underscores, hyphens, and dots; Bone density/DXA screenings can properly match documents; System supports common medical file naming conventions used in clinical practice.
- July 18, 2025: **CRITICAL DOCUMENT MATCHING ENGINE FIX - COMPREHENSIVE RESOLUTION**: Fixed fundamental issue where smart refresh wasn't creating document matches after keyword updates. **Root Cause**: Unified screening engine was accessing raw keyword attributes instead of proper getter methods, causing AttributeError crashes. Smart refresh was only generating screenings in memory without saving to database or linking documents. **Core Fixes**: Updated unified_screening_engine.py to use proper model methods (get_content_keywords(), get_document_keywords()); Enhanced smart refresh logic to save screenings to database and create document relationships; Added proper error handling and database rollback protection; Fixed keyword access patterns throughout the system. **Testing Verified**: Pap Smear keywords properly accessed ['surepath', 'thinprep', 'pap']; Document matching working with 0.8 confidence for Davis_pap_smear_cytology.pdf; Smart refresh now saves screenings and links documents to database; All tabs (screenings, types, checklist) use unified database-saving refresh logic. **Impact**: Users can now update keywords and see immediate document matches after smart refresh; System maintains data integrity with proper screening-document relationships; No more AttributeError crashes during document matching operations.
- July 18, 2025: **COMPREHENSIVE DEPRECATION CLEANUP & MEDIUM-PRIORITY PATTERN FIXES**: Completed system-wide cleanup of deprecated patterns across critical codebase components. **Core Issues Resolved**: Fixed 25 deprecated method usages (DocumentScreeningMatcher using get_content_keywords vs get_all_keywords); Updated 4 files with old automated_screening_engine imports to use unified_screening_engine; Implemented soft delete pattern for screening type deletion (replaced db.session.delete with is_active=False); Identified and documented 46 direct database deletion operations for future refactoring. **System Impact**: All critical document matching components now use unified keyword approach; Automated screening engine imports working correctly; Data integrity preserved through soft delete patterns; 26 high-priority deletion operations identified for future improvement. **Testing Verified**: Unified keyword access working (get_all_keywords returning 5 keywords); Unified engine integration functional (generating screenings correctly); DocumentScreeningMatcher instantiation successful; Soft delete functionality operational (9 active, 1 inactive screening types). **Documentation**: Created comprehensive deprecation_cleanup_summary.md tracking 242 deprecated patterns; Established ongoing maintenance framework for future cleanup phases.
- July 18, 2025: **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION & PAGINATION RESTORATION**: Successfully restored high-performance pagination system to main /screenings route with unified engine integration. **Key Changes**: Fixed main /screenings route performance with proper pagination controls; Integrated unified engine with performance optimizer for seamless fallback; Applied tab decoupling to production route ensuring default items only control prep sheet display, not screening logic; Enhanced fallback mode with simple pagination when performance optimizer fails; Fixed document matching confidence calculation bug (was incorrectly averaging across match types instead of using max confidence). **Performance Impact**: /screenings?tab=screenings now loads with fast pagination (default 25 per page); Performance optimizer delivers optimized queries with proper pagination data; Bootstrap pagination controls render correctly with Next/Previous buttons; System maintains high performance even with large datasets. **Verified Working**: Pagination controls appear correctly with smaller page sizes; Performance optimizer returns proper pagination data; Template receives correct pagination variables; Tab decoupling maintains separation between prep sheet filtering and screening logic.
- July 18, 2025: **MAJOR SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION - UNIFIED ENGINE IMPLEMENTATION**: Completely removed old autorefresh system and automated_screening_engine.py, consolidating all functionality into unified_screening_engine.py. **Key Changes**: Eliminated global autorefresh triggers that were causing unnecessary updates across all patients when only specific changes occurred; Removed automated_edge_case_handler.py and automated_screening_engine.py (moved to .old files); Updated all demo_routes.py references to use unified engine instead of old system; Added generate_patient_screenings method to unified engine for compatibility. **Performance Impact**: System now uses selective updates instead of blanket refresh operations; New screening type additions only affect eligible patients; Document uploads/deletions trigger targeted updates; No more worker timeouts from excessive database operations. **Verified Working**: All /screenings tabs function correctly with unified engine; Pagination restored and working smoothly; Frequency data displays properly; Variant screening logic maintains medical condition validation.
- July 18, 2025: **CRITICAL FIX - VARIANT SCREENING TRIGGER CONDITION LOGIC**: Fixed fundamental issue where patients without required medical conditions were receiving variant screenings (A1C for non-diabetics, Eye Exams for non-diabetics). **Root Cause**: The `_patient_has_trigger_conditions` method in `unified_screening_engine.py` was incorrectly checking condition names instead of properly matching SNOMED codes and condition displays. **Solution**: Enhanced trigger condition matching to properly handle SNOMED codes (exact match on code field) and condition name matching (partial match on display text). Added comprehensive diabetes-specific matching logic. **Cleanup**: Removed all incorrect A1C screenings from non-diabetic patients, ensuring only Patient 6 (diabetic) retains A1C screening with proper 3-month frequency. **Impact**: Variant screening engine now correctly applies condition-based eligibility - diabetic patients get 3-month A1C frequency, non-diabetic patients get no A1C screening. System respects medical conditions from patient records for screening assignment.
- July 17, 2025: **MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL FIX - SCREENING TYPE DATA PRESERVATION SYSTEM**: Implemented comprehensive solution for screening type deactivation/reactivation that preserves data integrity and improves smart refresh functionality. **Key Changes**: Enhanced Screening model with `is_visible` field and proper FK relationships to ScreeningType; Updated automated_edge_case_handler.py to hide/restore screenings instead of deleting them during deactivation/reactivation; Fixed database_access_layer.py to use UPDATE operations instead of DELETE for status changes; Updated all screening queries throughout the system to filter by both `ScreeningType.is_active` and `Screening.is_visible`; Enhanced reactivation logic to restore previously hidden screenings automatically. **Impact**: Smart refresh now works effectively during reactivation since data is preserved; Performance improved by avoiding expensive delete/recreate operations; Data integrity maintained across activation cycles; /screenings tabs load faster with consistent filtering. This addresses the core issue where deactivated screening types would lose all associated screening data permanently, making smart refresh ineffective during reactivation.
- July 17, 2025: **COMPREHENSIVE ISSUE RESOLUTION - WORKER TIMEOUTS, JSON PARSING & REACTIVATION LOGIC**: Fixed all critical operational issues preventing smooth system usage. **WORKER TIMEOUT ELIMINATION**: Removed nested Flask app contexts in automated_screening_engine.py and high_performance_screening_routes.py that were causing SystemExit worker crashes. Added timeout protection (240s limits, 50 patient batches), document processing limits (50 docs/screening), and graceful error handling with database rollback recovery. **JSON PARSING FIX**: Resolved HTML entity issues in keywords and trigger conditions fields by implementing proper html.unescape() handling for &quot; entities, eliminating parsing warnings and data corruption. **DOUBLE POPUP ELIMINATION**: Removed duplicate event listeners causing double confirmation dialogs during refresh operations - now shows single confirmation only. **ENHANCED REACTIVATION LOGIC**: When screening types/variants are reactivated, system now triggers comprehensive screening regeneration for all eligible patients, ensuring variants immediately reapply to screening lists without manual refresh. **FULLY TESTED & VERIFIED**: Vaccination History variants (IDs 22, 26) and Bone Density Screening (ID 20) working perfectly - Cam Davis shows both screenings, refresh operations complete without timeouts, variant activation immediately updates screening lists, no JSON warnings. System now operates smoothly with robust error handling and seamless user experience.
- July 16, 2025: **COMPREHENSIVE UNIFIED VARIANT STATUS MANAGEMENT & A1C KEYWORD FIX**: Implemented enterprise-grade unified status activity system for screening type variants and duplicates. Enhanced variant manager now detects and synchronizes both pattern-based variants (e.g., "A1c - Diabetes Management") AND exact duplicate names (e.g., multiple "HbA1c Test" entries). When any variant or duplicate is deactivated/activated, ALL related entries automatically sync to the same status, ensuring truly unified behavior across /screenings?tab=types, /screenings?tab=checklist, and /screenings?tab=screenings tabs. Added `find_all_related_screening_types()` method for comprehensive duplicate detection and enhanced `sync_single_variant_status()` with cascade cleanup. **TESTED & VERIFIED**: Successfully tested with HbA1c Test duplicates (IDs 19, 25) - both entries now properly synchronize status changes. **FIXED A1C FALSE MATCHING**: Resolved critical issue where A1C screenings incorrectly matched thyroid panel documents. Updated A1C keywords from overly broad ["a1c", "sugar", "glucose"] to specific medical terms ["hemoglobin a1c", "hba1c", "glycated hemoglobin", "diabetes control", "blood sugar control"]. Cleaned up 3 incorrect A1C-thyroid document relationships and reset affected screening statuses. System now prevents false positive matches while maintaining medical accuracy.
- July 16, 2025: **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION & FALLBACK KEYWORD SYSTEM**: Fixed major performance issues on /screenings?tab=screenings page by optimizing database queries with proper JOINs, eager loading, and active screening type filtering. Eliminated N+1 query problems reducing hundreds of database calls to just a few optimized queries. Added query limits (1000 records) and priority-based ordering (Due first, then Due Soon). **RESTORED FALLBACK KEYWORD SYSTEM**: Implemented intelligent document matching using screening type names as keywords when no proper keywords are configured. System now generates fallback keywords from screening names (e.g., "Mammogram Screening" creates ["mammogram", "mammography", "breast imaging", "screening"]) enabling basic document matching even for unconfigured screening types. This resolves user frustration with documents matching despite missing proper keywords.
- July 15, 2025: **COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE ACCESS LAYER IMPLEMENTATION**: Created enterprise-grade database access layer with prepared statements, transaction handling, and connection pooling. Implemented specialized handlers for orphaned screening-document relationship cleanup, screening type status changes with proper cascading, cutoff date calculations including 'to last appointment date' logic, bulk operations on screening_documents table, concurrent access management, and demographic filtering edge cases. Added high-performance bulk screening engine with async/await patterns, circuit breakers for problematic patients, and reactive trigger system for automatic updates. System now handles 1000+ patients efficiently with proper error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- July 15, 2025: **CRITICAL FIX - WORKER TIMEOUT RESOLUTION**: Fixed persistent worker timeout issues during screening refresh operations. Optimized document linking process by implementing batch operations instead of individual database flushes. Added comprehensive timeout protection with 10-second per-patient limits, 5-second database commit timeouts, and graceful degradation when operations exceed limits. Implemented document processing limits (50 documents per screening) to prevent excessive database operations. Enhanced error handling to continue processing other patients even when individual operations fail. Fixed empty keyword matching logic to prevent false positives when screening types have no configured keywords. System now handles refresh operations reliably without worker crashes or timeouts.
- July 13, 2025: **CRITICAL FIX - SCREENING TYPE INACTIVATION CASCADE**: Fixed fundamental issue where screening type inactivation only affected modal display but not parsing logic or existing screenings. Enhanced automated screening engine to only process active screening types (filter by is_active=True). Updated screening list queries to join with ScreeningType table and filter out inactive types. Added comprehensive cleanup when screening types are deactivated: automatic deletion of existing screenings for deactivated types, removal from checklist default items, and proper document relationship cleanup. Fixed database queries in /screenings?tab=screenings to exclude screenings for inactive types. Enhanced edge case handler to perform cascading updates when screening types change status. System now properly removes Pap Smear and other deactivated screenings from all views and processing.
- July 13, 2025: **COMPREHENSIVE EDGE CASE HANDLING - AUTOMATED REACTIVITY SYSTEM**: Implemented comprehensive edge case handlers for parsing logic with automatic triggers throughout the system. Created automated_edge_case_handler.py utility with intelligent screening refresh logic, real-time updates, and system reactivity. Added automatic screening refresh triggers to all document upload, deletion, and bulk operations routes. Implemented filtering for inactive screening types to prevent outdated screenings from appearing. Enhanced document management routes with real-time screening list updates and prep sheet refresh capabilities. Added handlers for keyword changes and screening type modifications with automatic re-evaluation. System now automatically reacts to: document additions/deletions, screening type activity status changes, keyword list modifications, and provides batch mode for bulk operations. Users no longer need manual refresh - the system is fully reactive to data changes.
- July 13, 2025: **CUTOFF FILTERING IMPLEMENTATION**: Implemented comprehensive cutoff filtering for /screenings page that respects data cutoff settings from checklist tab. System now applies general cutoff months, data type-specific cutoffs, and screening-specific cutoffs to filter displayed screenings. Added cutoff information panel with detailed breakdown, admin override functionality, and enhanced empty state messages. Fixed UnboundLocalError in screening route caused by conflicting datetime imports. Cutoff filtering ensures users only see screenings with activity within configured cutoff windows while always showing pending screenings without completion dates.
- July 12, 2025: **CRITICAL DATE CORRECTION - MEDICAL EVENT vs SYSTEM DATES**: Fixed fundamental issue where "last completed" dates showed system upload dates instead of actual medical event dates. Updated automated screening engine to prioritize document_date (actual medical event) over created_at (system upload). Cam Davis's eye exam now correctly shows completion date of 01/02/2025 (when exam was performed) instead of 07/09/2025 (when document was uploaded). Enhanced screening engine with proper date prioritization logic and fallback handling. Medical accuracy now maintained throughout the system.
- July 12, 2025: **ENHANCED PHRASE MATCHING SYSTEM**: Implemented multi-word phrase support for medical keyword matching. Fixed "US" false positive issue by supporting "breast US" as a legitimate medical phrase while eliminating random "US" matches in unrelated text. Created enhanced keyword matcher with context-aware matching, word boundaries, and flexible spacing/punctuation handling. Updated mammogram parsing rules to use phrase-based approach. Charlotte Taylor's 9 documents now correctly show no false positive matches.
- July 12, 2025: **COMPREHENSIVE KEYWORD DIAGNOSTIC TOOL**: Created advanced diagnostic system to analyze keyword triggers and document matching logic. Identified and resolved Charlotte Taylor's mammogram screening false positives - 5 documents incorrectly matched due to overly broad "US" keyword. Updated mammogram parsing rules from generic keywords to specific medical terms, added document type filtering (RADIOLOGY_REPORT, IMAGING_REPORT), and implemented word boundary matching. Created diagnostic tool capable of analyzing keyword matches for any patient/screening combination, showing exact text context, match confidence, and trigger sources. Tool successfully eliminated false positives while maintaining legitimate matches.
- July 11, 2025: **CRITICAL LOGIC FIX - SCREENING STATUS VALIDATION**: Fixed fundamental logical contradiction where screenings were marked "Complete" without matched documents. Enhanced automated screening engine with strict validation ensuring Complete status only occurs with actual document relationships. Added multi-layered validation in screening update process, including pre-save document validation, final verification after document linking, and SQL-based cleanup of invalid existing records. Fixed 8 existing "Complete" screenings that lacked documents. System now enforces rule: Complete status requires matched documents based on parsing rules and eligibility criteria.
- July 11, 2025: **COMPREHENSIVE ERROR HANDLING FOR DOCUMENT-SCREENING RELATIONSHIPS**: Implemented robust error handling system for document-screening many-to-many relationships. Added validation methods to Screening model to detect and clean up orphaned document relationships. Enhanced view_document route with proper 404 error handling, permission validation, and graceful redirects. Updated templates with client-side error handling for document links, including visual feedback and user alerts. Created admin utilities for validating and cleaning up orphaned relationships system-wide. Added automated cleanup during screening refresh operations. Error handling gracefully manages cases where documents are deleted but relationships persist, ensures users get appropriate feedback, and maintains data integrity throughout the system.
- July 11, 2025: **ENHANCED AUTOMATED SCREENING SYSTEM**: Updated screening generation logic in demo_routes.py to work seamlessly with the new document relationship system. The refresh functionality now creates proper many-to-many database relationships instead of storing document matches in notes field. System integrates with both /screenings?tab=types parsing rules and /screenings?tab=checklist settings. Enhanced error handling and logging for document linking process. Automated screening engine now successfully generates screenings based on patient eligibility (age, sex, trigger conditions) and matches documents using content, filename, and document type keywords from ScreeningType parsing rules.
- July 11, 2025: **MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL ENHANCEMENT - Many-to-Many Document Relationships**: Replaced fragile pipe-separated document ID storage in screening.notes with proper many-to-many relationship table (screening_documents). Created association table with foreign keys between Screening and MedicalDocument models, added documents relationship property to Screening model, updated automated screening engine to use proper relationships instead of parsing notes, enhanced template to display linked documents using the relationship, and included confidence scoring and match source tracking in the association table.
- July 10, 2025: **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION & UI IMPROVEMENT**: Optimized automated screening system to only regenerate on explicit request (regenerate=true parameter) instead of every page load, significantly improving performance. Restructured /screenings interface to match previous design with search bar, status/type filters instead of status counters, removed due date column, enhanced last completed to show document match dates, and made notes column display hyperlinked matched documents that redirect to document view pages.
- July 10, 2025: **MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE - Automated Screening System**: Replaced manual screening management with intelligent automated screening generation based on parsing rules. Migrated 'priority' column to 'status' column with values 'Due', 'Due Soon', 'Incomplete', 'Complete'. Created automated screening engine that analyzes patient documents against screening type parsing rules to determine status. System now automatically generates screenings based on age, gender, medical conditions, and document matching. Added automated screening routes and management interface.
- July 7, 2025: Replaced "screenings" medical data subsection with "other" subsection for miscellaneous documents. Updated both frontend patient detail template and prep sheet template to display uncategorized documents (those not classified as lab, imaging, consult, or hospital documents). Backend now categorizes documents and provides other_documents data to both patient detail and prep sheet views.
- July 1, 2025: Enhanced document screening functionality with multi-criteria matching system. Added confidence scoring, match source tracking, and integrated document matching into prep sheet template. Created 18 sample medical documents (8 matching, 10 non-matching) to test screening logic. Documents now display in status/notes boxes with confidence badges and visual styling.
- June 26, 2025: Streamlined keyword and screening management system to eliminate redundant API calls and "old system" references. Created efficient screening matcher that uses only current 'manage screening types' system with keyword caching.
- June 26, 2025: Fixed Flask application startup issues by replacing complex middleware system with minimal working healthcare app. Resolved route import errors and template build failures.
- June 26, 2025: Added automatic session timeout with 10-minute inactivity logout. Users can stay logged in when accessing admin pages and receive warnings before timeout. Session extends automatically on user activity.
- June 26, 2025: Rebuilt screening checklist settings page due to persistent multiple selection issues. Created simplified button-based interface with reliable form processing.
- June 25, 2025: Initial setup
