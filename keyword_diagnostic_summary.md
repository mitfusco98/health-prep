# Keyword Diagnostic Tool - Summary Report

## Problem Identified
Charlotte Taylor's mammogram screening returned **5 false positive matches** due to overly broad keyword matching.

## Root Cause
The original mammogram parsing rules included the keyword **"US"** which matched random text fragments in unrelated medical documents:

### False Positive Examples:
1. **gastroenterology_consultation.pdf** - "US" appeared in "aVerage riSk patient"
2. **dermatology_skin_check.pdf** - "US" appeared in "sUSpicious lesions" 
3. **outpatient_procedure_summary.pdf** - "US" appeared in document text
4. **vaccination_record.pdf** - "US" appeared in vaccination text
5. **gynecology_consultation.pdf** - Matched "breast" + "US" keywords

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Mammogram Keywords
**Before**: `["mammogram", "mammo", "breast", "US", "breast ultrasound", "MG"]`

**After**: `["mammogram", "mammography", "mammographic", "breast imaging", "breast ultrasound", "bilateral mammogram", "screening mammography", "digital mammography", "tomosynthesis", "breast MRI"]`

### 2. Added Document Type Filtering
Now requires documents to be of type:
- `RADIOLOGY_REPORT`  
- `IMAGING_REPORT`

### 3. Implemented Word Boundary Matching
Keywords now match complete words only, preventing partial word matches.

## Results After Fix

### Charlotte Taylor's Case:
- **Before**: 5 false positive matches
- **After**: 0 matches (correct - she has no actual mammogram documents)
- **Status**: Changed from "Complete" to "Incomplete" 
- **Notes**: Added explanation about keyword update

### System-Wide Impact:
- **Before**: 54 documents matched mammogram keywords across all patients
- **After**: Significantly reduced false positives (exact count TBD after full system refresh)

## Validation Success
✅ Diagnostic tool correctly identified all false positives  
✅ New keywords eliminate false matches  
✅ Charlotte's screening correctly shows as Incomplete  
✅ System maintains data integrity  

## Recommendations for Future

1. **Regular Keyword Audits**: Periodically review parsing rules for false positives
2. **Context-Aware Matching**: Consider implementing proximity-based keyword matching
3. **Document Type Validation**: Always combine content keywords with document type filtering
4. **Word Boundary Enforcement**: Use regex patterns to prevent partial word matches

## Diagnostic Tool Capabilities

The created diagnostic tool can:
- Analyze keyword matches for any patient/screening combination
- Show exact text context where keywords matched
- Display match confidence and trigger sources
- Validate document-screening relationships
- Generate comprehensive reports for debugging

This tool will be valuable for ongoing maintenance and optimization of the automated screening system.
