# Enhanced Phrase Matching Implementation Summary

## Problem Resolution

You were absolutely correct about the keyword processing issue. The problem was that simple string matching for "US" created false positives when it appeared within other words like "sUSpicious" or "riSk". 

## Solution: Multi-Word Phrase Support

   - Supports phrases like "breast US", "breast imaging"

   - Handles flexible spacing/punctuation: "breast US", "breast-US", "breast_US"

2. **Context-Aware Matching**
   - Extracts surrounding text context for verification
   - Calculates confidence scores based on match quality
   - Distinguishes between single words and phrases

3. **Medical-Specific Logic**
   - Combines content matching with document type filtering
   - Requires both content relevance AND appropriate document type
   - Prevents false positives in unrelated medical documents
